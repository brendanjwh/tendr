# README

Welcome to Tendr!  Finally you can peruse cocktail recipes sorted for YOU based on what bottles you have in your home bar.  Tendr allows users to search the user-generated cocktail database for recipes via tags (i.e. "up", "whiskey", "simple syrup", "campari", etc).  One can register with Tendr and establish the contents of their home bar.  From there, a wide range of custom search filters allows the user to narrow down what cocktails he or she can actually make based on their personal inventory, by popularity, by styles of cocktails, by presentation, etc.  

You don't have to be logged in either.  Just select the tags from the tag bank on the front page and Tendr curates a list of cocktail recipes sorted by popularity.  

Each recipe has a comments section for users to leave their thoughts and ideas for all to see!

Tendr uses Postgresql for database management.  Tendr is running on Heroku at https://secure-retreat-30963.herokuapp.com.
